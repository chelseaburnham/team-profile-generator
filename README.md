# team-profile-generator

##  Description
This application generates an index.html using node.js. The index.html will contain employee cards with the employee's name, role(manager, engineer, intern), id number, and email. It also includes additional questions depending on the employee's role. For example, when you begin the application, you will automatically fill out he information of the manager and include office number. After that, if you select engineer, you will be prompted to include your GitHub username; otherwise, if you select intern, then you will be promted to input the name of your school. There is no limit to how many engineers and interns you can add to the team; however, once you finish typing in the employees you would like to add and select "none", an index.html will be written using fs.writefile.
